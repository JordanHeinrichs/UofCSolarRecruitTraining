Basic-Recruit-Training
-----------------------

This Exercise is designed to introduce you to the concepts of pointers, references, functions, and class creation in C++.

In this exercise, you must create the `Person.cpp` file and implement the definition of all of the functions within `Person.h`. In addition, you must complete the definitions of `mySwap()` and `myIncrement()` and implement them in `main.cpp`. You are not permitted to modify anything in `Person.h` or any of the function headers. The program will verify that you have correctly completed the exercise.

This project was designed for the Code::Blocks IDE, download here from http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/binaries. Make sure that the binary you download contains the mingw compiler, i.e `codeblocks-16.01mingw-setup.exe`
