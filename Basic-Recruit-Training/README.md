# Basic-Recruit-Training

This Exercise is designed to introduce you to the concepts of pointers, references, functions, and class creation in C++.
In this exercise, you will have to create the Person.cpp file and implement the definition of all of the functions within Person.h, as well as complete the definitions of `mySwap()` and `myIncrement()`. The program will verify that you have correctly completed the exercise.

This project was designed for the Code::Blocks IDE, download here from www.codeblocks.org. Codeblocks requires a compiler, you can download the GNU GCC compiler from https://sourceforge.net/projects/tdm-gcc/?source=typ_redirect
