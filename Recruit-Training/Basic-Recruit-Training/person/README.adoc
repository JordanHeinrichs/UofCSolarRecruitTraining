= Person

This exercise is designed to introduce you to the concepts of pointers, references, functions, and class creation in C++.

In this exercise, you must create the `Person.cpp` file and implement the definition of all of the functions within `Person.h`.
In addition, you must complete the definitions of `mySwap()` and `myIncrement()` and implement them in `main.cpp`.
You are not permitted to modify anything in `Person.h` or any of the function headers.
The program will verify that you have correctly completed the exercise.
