= Style Guide

This is a general style guide for the Solar Car Team, individual projects can deviate from this style guide but this is for general practice. Anything not listed here is dependent on the project.

== General

=== Naming
Avoid abbreviations.

===== Bad Example
	UofC

===== Good Example
	UniversityOfCalgary

== C++

Follow AStyle, bindings are available in sublime and vim.
To install the latest version in debian based operating systems:

```bash
wget 'https://sourceforge.net/projects/astyle/files/astyle/astyle%202.06/astyle_2.06_linux.tar.gz/download'
tar -zxvf download
cd astyle/build/gcc
make release
sudo make install
```

To format a file with default astyle settings:
```bash
astyle filename
```

To recursively format all `.cpp` and `.h` files:
```bash
astyle "*.cpp" "*.h" -r
```

To use the provided `astylerc` options file:
```bash
astyle --options=/path/to/astylerc filename
```

The `astylerc` file located beside this README is the official astyle options file for the UofC Solar Car Team.

To check in a script whether are files are formatted correctly:
```bash
astyle "*.h" "*.cpp" -r --dry-run --options=/path/to/astylerc | grep Formatted
```

=== Function Names
Function names should be lower camel case.

===== Example
	thisFunctionName()

=== Variable Names
Variable names should be lower camel case as well.

===== Example
	aGoodVariable

=== Constant Names
Constants should be all caps separated by underscores.

===== Example
