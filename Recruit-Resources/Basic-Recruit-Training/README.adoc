= Basic C++ Training

This Exercise is designed to introduce you to the concepts of pointers, references, functions, and class creation in C++.

In this exercise, you must create the `Person.cpp` file and implement the definition of all of the functions within `Person.h`.
In addition, you must complete the definitions of `mySwap()` and `myIncrement()` in `main.cpp` and use them in the main function.
You are not permitted to modify anything in `Person.h` or any of the function headers.
The program will verify that you have correctly completed the exercise.

This project was designed for the Code::Blocks IDE, download at the link:from http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/binaries[Codeblocks website].
Make sure that the binary you download contains the mingw compiler, i.e `codeblocks-16.01mingw-setup.exe`
