= Pull Requests

All changes to master branches of repos under the UCSolarCarTeam must be done through a pull request, unless otherwise permitted by the software manager. Mandating pull-requests serves two main purposes.

.  All code is reviewed by someone other than the author before being used.
.  Members of the Solar Car Team learn how to do pull-requests so that they can contribute to other open-source projects.

All pull requests should be done through reviewable, a "Reviewable" button is available at the top of the pull request.
If the button is not there, that means Reviewable has not been activated for that repository, contact the current software manager.
Reviewable is a Github plugin to improve the code review process.
With reviewable you can mark files as reviewed or not making partial reviews easier.
Reviewable also allows for comments to be set as approved, meaning an issue with a pull request can be pointed out and can be manually set to resolved or not.
With reviewable it is also possible to view a subset of changes with a larger granularity than per commit.

== How to Make a Pull Request

Here are the steps to contributing to a UCSolarCarTeam repository. The repositories can be found at https://github.com/UCSolarCarTeam. These steps assume you have a Github account, know how to use git, and are a member of the UCSolarCarTeam organization on Github.

.  Go to the repository you wish to contribute to under the UCSolarCarTeam. Clone the repository into your computer.
.  Create a new branch by `git checkout -b NewBranchName`.
.  Push the branch to the remote using the command `git push -u origin NewBranchName`.
.  Now you can make whatever changes you wish to that branch, complete the feature or change you wish done on that branch.
.  Once all changes on your branch have been made and you wish to merge this with the master branch, you can create the pull request on github.
.  Click "Pull requests" on the right side, then click "New pull request" on the top right.
.  Select the master branch (or whatever branch you wish to merge into) on the left, then the branch you have made changes with on the right.
.  Write a title and description of what the pull request is and includes.
.  Wait for people to review the pull-request, respond accordingly and let someone else accept the merge. Even if you have the rights, DO NOT merge the pull-request yourself.

== How to Respond to a Pull Request

If you have been assigned to a pull request, please respond as soon as possible, in general responding to a pull request should have priority over implementing other features. On top of those technical responsibilities, you are also responsible for responding to a pull request in a caring fashion. To promote pull request responses that are kind and helpful, take these steps in responding to a pull request:

. *Is the purpose of the pull request sound?* Do the overall changes make sense?
. *Is the code properly structured?* Will the code be maintainable in the future?
. *Are there any bugs or glitches?* Test the code yourself to make sure it works.
. *Is the coding style correct?* Does the code conform to how the rest of the project is coded? Does it follow the UCSolarCarDevelopmentGuide style guide?

Especially for newcomers, make sure the pull request passes one step at a time. The idea is so that a pull request won't be done all at once, but in a couple "passes". Once all the steps have been passed, then the pull request should be ready to be merged!
