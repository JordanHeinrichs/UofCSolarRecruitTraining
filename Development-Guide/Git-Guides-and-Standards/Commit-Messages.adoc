## Making Commit Messages

To ensure proper commit history as more contributors work through projects,
please follow these standards:

```
<JIRA-Issue-Number> Short (72 chars or less) summary.

More detailed explanatory text. Wrap it to 72 characters. The blank
line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
the body entirely).

Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed
bug" or "Fixes bug." This convention matches up with commit messages
generated by commands like git merge and git revert.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

- Bullet points are okay, too.
- Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, followed by a
  single space. Use a hanging indent.
```

#### Subject line

The subject line should prefixed with the issue number (if applicable), and be able to answer the question:

_If applied, this commit will <your subject line here>_

#### Information in commit messages

The summary should be in paragraph form and should discuss the _whys_ of the change, for example, why the specific bug occurred or why this particular change works.

Documentation or references can be linked depending on how complicated the change is.

If the developer & reviewer agree that the change is trivial or simple enough that just the subject line is explanatory, then an extra paragraph is not needed.

### Example commit message

```
SFT-234 Change the units of cell voltages from mV to V

Based on testing and feedback, it was found that it works better on the displays for the voltages to be displayed in V than mV.

```

#### Changing commit messages

You can edit your commit history through rebasing. 
If you want to change the history of the last 3 commits, run:
`git rebase HEAD~3 -i`

Multiple options will appear, including the ability to reword commit messages, 
squash commits together, and more. 
See https://robots.thoughtbot.com/git-interactive-rebase-squash-amend-rewriting-history[this link] for more comprehensive documentation on rebasing.

This tool will help you keep the commit history of your branch clean.
However, it can be incredibly dangerous. *NEVER change the commit history of the master branch (or any shared branch) for any reason.* 

#### Linking to JIRA

To link to an item on JIRA, simply include the issue number somewhere in the commit message.

Each commit needs to have a reference to the JIRA ticket for it to be shown on the issue page.

There are also https://bigbrassband.com/git-integration-for-jira/documentation/smart-commits.html[various tags] that can be used in the commit message to enact different effects on JIRA issues.
