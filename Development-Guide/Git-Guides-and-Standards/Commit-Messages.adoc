## Making Commit Messages

To ensure proper commit history as more contributors work through projects,
please follow these standards:

```
Short (72 chars or less) summary.

More detailed explanatory text. Wrap it to 72 characters. The blank
line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
the body entirely).

Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed
bug" or "Fixes bug." This convention matches up with commit messages
generated by commands like git merge and git revert.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

- Bullet points are okay, too.
- Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, followed by a
  single space. Use a hanging indent.
```

Your commit title should be phrased so it can answer the question "If this commit is applied, it will..."

### Example commit message

```
Change the units of cell voltages from mV to V

Based on testing and feedback....
```

#### Subject line

The subject line should be able to describe the effects of the patch:

_If applied, this commit will <your subject line here>_

#### Information in commit messages

The summary should be in paragraph form and should discuss the _whys_ of the change,
linking to any documentation or references depending on how complicated the change is.

#### Changing commit messages

You can edit your commit history through rebasing. 
If you want to change the history of the last 3 commits, run:
`git rebase HEAD~3 -i`

Multiple options will appear, including the ability to reword commit messages, 
squash commits together, and more. 
See https://robots.thoughtbot.com/git-interactive-rebase-squash-amend-rewriting-history[this link] for more comprehensive documentation on rebasing.

This tool will help you keep the commit history of your branch clean.
However, it can be incredibly dangerous. *NEVER change the commit history of the master branch for any reason.*
