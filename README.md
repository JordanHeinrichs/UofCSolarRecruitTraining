The main reason why we use Linux is to have a similar environment to the Raspberry Pi.
Another reason why we use Linux is because our software only works on Linux right now.
We recommend two options if you do not have Linux already.

# Dual booting [Highly Recommended] 

## Background Knowledge 
--------------- 
Dual booting will keep 2 operating systems on your machine (only one operating system will be running on your machine at a time), so when you first start your computer, you can choose which operating system you want to run on.
We highly recommend dual booting since you can utilize 100% of your computer's hardware for only one operating system(using a Virtual Machine, shares the PC hardware between operating systems; see VM Section).

Pros | Cons
------------- | -------------
computer's performance is maximized since it only needs to focus on the one operating system  | Switching between operating systems requires you to reboot the computer

For both dual booting and installing Linux on a VM, get a Linux distribution of your choice.
   ### Recommended distros are

   	* Linux Mint (Latest Version)
   	* Ubuntu (Latest Version)

# Running Linux in a Virtual Machine 

## Background Knowledge 
A virtual machine allows two operating systems to run simultaneously (Sharing the computer's hardware).
Using a virtual machine separates the host machine and the simulated machine, so if you are running linux in the virtual machine and windows as your main OS, they will have no idea that each other exist.

Pros | Cons
------------- | -------------
You can switch between operating systems by simply minimizing/maximizing the virtual machine  | the performance of your machine will be reduced (Makes working on projects difficult)

**If you have a powerful PC and want to take the risk of the performance reduction, feel free to use this option.**
